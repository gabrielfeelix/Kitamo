# Frontend Design (Always Read)

ALWAYS apply these principles when working on the frontend (Vue components, Tailwind CSS, HTML, JS) for Kitamo. DO NOT skip these checks to avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Make distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces.

## 1. Design Thinking 

Before executing any frontend task:
- Commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction (e.g., brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, etc.).
- NEVER deliver generic aesthetics.
- Pick a differentiation factor: what makes this unforgettable?

## 2. Guidelines to Abide By

- **Typography**: NO generic fonts (Inter, Roboto, Arial). Opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics; unexpected, characterful font choices. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.
- **Color & Theme**: Bold combinations. Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes.
- **Motion**: High-impact moments. Use Scroll-triggering, unexpected hover states, staggered reveals (animation-delay).
- **Spatial Composition**: Asymmetry. Overlap. Diagonal flow. Generous negative space OR controlled density. Break grids thoughtfully.
- **Visuals**: Create depth. Add contextual effects. Gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows.

## 3. Strict Prohibitions

- NO generic AI-generated aesthetics.
- NO completely predictable layouts or cookie-cutter template designs.
- NO generic cliched color schemes (especially purple gradients on white backgrounds without context).

Whether minimalist or maximalist, the key is strictly adhering to the chosen vision, pushing the boundaries of creativity and technical implementation constraints. Execute your vision perfectly to produce an outstanding UI.
